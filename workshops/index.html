          <p>The connection between the two players on stage is one of the most fundementally important things to a good improv scene.  When we connect, our scene is simplified and our job as improvisers becomes one of simple reaction.  If we can't connect, we're left playing at each other instead of with each other.  In this workshop, we'll explore a myriad of ways to connect with your scene partner in your scenes and discover simpler, more honest, funnier scenes.</p>

          <p>Tired of “talking heads” in your improv scenes? Physical Theatre relies on physical motion of the performers to convey the story. In this workshop, performers will experiment through physical impulse and expression to create characters, environment, and story. Using the exploration techniques of Laban Movement Analysis and Jerzy Grotowski as a framework, performers will find new ways to create and explore the function of the human body and mind in creative expression.  The workshop will provide an improved physical awareness, concentration, connection to scene partner, developing creativity and working off of impulse.</p>

          <p>Do you feel like your scene work is inconsistent? Like sometimes you're just 'on' and sometimes you just want to crawl up in a ball and roll off the stage into anonymity? Let's change that! A lot of improvisers make things way harder than they have to be. We're going to go through specific techniques and exercises to simplify your scene work so that it feels easy by making strong choices, using POV, and building instant relationships. You'll have a lot of fun and walk away with at least one technique that you can use in your next show!</p>
