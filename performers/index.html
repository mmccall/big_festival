        <h4>Baltimore, MD</h4>
        <p>The Bully Union: Local 128 was formed with the aim of creating grounded, long-form performances which organically explore a series of connected ideas through a narrative of interweaving scenes.  By then adapting this format to incorporate thematic frameworks, intersections between topic and context drive us to explore new ideas and find unexpected answers.  Over the past year, we have performed throughout the US, including in Washington, Providence, and Chicago.  Combining our approach with the eccentric and unique perspective of the city which brought us David Simon's The Wire and John Waters' Hairspray means we promise one thing; its gonna get weird.

The cast members are now scattered between New York, Chicago, and Baltimore but reunite regularly for festivals and special shows.

The troupe of fifteen players, professionally trained by Hartford Stage Company, ImprovBoston, and the Upright Citizens Brigade in New York, dazzles Hartford and beyond on a regular basis with their witty interpretations of audience suggestions. Sea Tea Improv performs short improvised games and long improvised plays at public and private functions, teaches classes to students of all ages, and trains professionals in the art of communication. They have performed all over Connecticut and New England. In our longform improv shows, Sea Tea Improv takes a single word or phrase from the audience and turns it into a play anywhere between twenty and ninety minutes. We created the romance-themed “Sex and the Sea Tea,” and are the current champs of the CT Comedy Cage Match, an annual 6-month-long longform improv competition series. Sea Tea Improv also hosts a monthly Longform Showcase, in which audiences see multiple teams performing various longform styles.

        <p>Now in its 5th Season, W.I.G.’s stellar journey continues! Mind-blowing storytelling and wig-wearing characters define W.I.G.'s distinct take on improv… featuring everything from the absurdly hilarious to the deeply touching, and everywhere in between! W.I.G. is an interactive experience… incorporating suggestions and performances from the audience. W.I.G.’s cast always includes an amazing mix of HCC students, alumni as well as guest artists, and performs in HCC’s theatres (often to sold out houses) as well as local venues.
